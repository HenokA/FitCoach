#Fitbit Coach Application

This is Henok's Senior Project for the Yale Computer Science Major.

##Scenario
###Enhanced Goal Setting
Katherine is a mid-twenties working woman who is attempting to lose 20 pounds. Katherine is not knowledgeable in fitness and arbitrarily exercises in hopes to reach long-term aesthetic/weight goals that she has set for herself. Ideally, Katherine would be able to propose some long-term goals which would allow the system to build a set of micro-goals tailored specifically to her profile based on other users’ trajectories towards similar goals in the past. 

###Motivational Tamagotchi
Sebastian is a grade school student who uses his Fitbit to compete with friends. He finds the simple step counter to be encouraging but over time has become less motivated by this primary goal. He also finds the virtual reward system on Fitbit to be unsatisfying. Ideally, Sebastian maintains his trajectory towards his goals and continues to improve. Now, Sebastian has an avatar that mimics his workout routine and that he can use to compete with his peers. The “Tamagotchi-style” motivation system will add depth to his online presence with his friends and will keep him motivated because he will feel not only motivation to beat his friends but social pressure to not have a weak avatar.
